I've been fighting this one for a while. I had OpenGL rendering out polygons for a while, but I had trouble getting my head around the defining and calling of functions in Objective C. Probably had something to do with trying to learn Objective C past midnight (probably the same rule as not feeding [Mogwi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins#Plot) ). Once you get the .m and .h thing down (or remember it), piece of cake. On another note, I can't believe how great screen recording works on a Mac, even with OUT OF BOX SOFTWARE. Have to work on my editing though.
