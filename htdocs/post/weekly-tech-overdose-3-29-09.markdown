Another (intended) weekly installment of what I've been using and interested about in the technology world. The tool I've been using that I absolutely love is [ManicTime](http://www.manictime.com/); if you have multiple projects and need to keep track of all your time towards billing clients or internal projects, this has saved a lot me a lot of overhead associated with keeping track of where the minutes go. The tool I am most excited to start using is [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx). I lost track of this when they were still calling it Monad, it seems to have come a long way in the community since.
