Updated collision engine to be 2D only, since that is the plane of movement. Made all movement (jumping, walking, external forces) to be vector-based physics. This adds more realistic starting and stopping, falling, and jumping. When object gets knocked back by an external force, friction coefficients eventually slow it down and stop.
