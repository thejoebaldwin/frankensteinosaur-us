Getting back on the blogtrain for my 100th post, gonna be photo-heavy. Current in mid-home-wreckery mode. Set up the office last week and the cords were UNWORKABLE, so this happened in 45 minutes or less:

Much better than the first time I studded a wall, which was about 1 wall per day. I did find out, however that you don't want to do the bullet-nail thing up against an outside corner, as it will blow out chunks of concrete and send them across the room. Shoulda put a stud 6 inches back from edge and bullet-nailed that instead. Wall went up so I could do this:

I got a lot of datas going in and out and wireless was not cutting it for youtube uploads, or anything else. Plus, I had to hook up the new [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide) and that needs a hard line. Here's my initial setup on the Pi (small circuit board to the right of the monitor)

The monitor is dormant as my HDMI to VGA adapter is in-route via Amazon, and the Kinect had a brief run with [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) but it's pretty apparent that the project is [dead](https://twitter.com/openkinect). Going to go with the Kinect SDK for voice recognition and probably just listen with some sockets on the Pi for processing and breadboard control. For the Pi OS I went with the Raspbian distro, so far so good. Still getting used to apt-get vs yum; either way, first foray out of pure-software into hardware control and I'm about as excited as humanly possible. 

**Edit 3.18.13 [@brocja01](http://twitter.com/brocja01) Short-term goal is for something like [this](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/breadboard/) controlled by kinect voice commands. I bought an Apple TV recently or I'd be definitely going the media box route. 

Next:
With the jacks in place (and a space-heater) I cranked out a Bingo-app for the juniors. No idea if one exists or not in the app store, but this one suits nicely for my bingo fans at home. Code is here at [Github](https://github.com/thejoebaldwin/ios-bingo). I find out that the bingo-card generator market is pretty saturated and nobody really delivers the goods. Excellent candidate for some niche destabilization.

**Edit 3.18.13: Ran my concept for pixellated fluid dynamics, on left is using a smooth gradient. Just stepping the gradient with hard edges should produce a pixel water effect right? No. Turns out I didn't have an accurate understanding of what the OpenGL alpha test does. Upgrading to Box2D project with Cocos2D 2.0, and am now learning about fragment shaders.

Foods:
After about 6 years of kitchen-aversion, some holladaise. Egg yolks, lemon juice and butter and you have yourself a budget heart-attack.

Hulked out on my success, I went for cream puffs. I had sworn off baking after absolutely nothing I made at the old house (and old electric oven) EVER turned out. Had thought I had lost the touch, but IT IS BACK with the Pate A Choux. Gas stove makes it, that's what I learned on and I despise electric stoves with all that I have.

Last:
New thing I hate: Dremel vs. Ceramic tile. Smells exactly like dentist grinding away a tooth, nearly barfed. Dremel got away from me and dremmeled my hand, but I'm pretty tough aside from the barfing. So this is going on via The Wife:

Tiles are $0.22 a piece, you're crazy to NOT be tiling right now. Hole is for a [pot-filler](http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=pot+fillers&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=7155175539&hvpos=1t2&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1487753732654414917&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&ref=pd_sl_8qp77kes1i_b), which you cannot buy here, must be ordered. Geographical Oddity.
