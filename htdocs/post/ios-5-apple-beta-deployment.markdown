I have an iOS developer license through Apple, so I wanted to get a preview of iOS 5 before it's public release on 10/12/11. I thought it would be pretty straightforward to deploy the GM Seed of iOS 5 to my iPad, and it was. I, however made it way, way, waaaay more complicated than it needed to be. During the course of my "deployment" I learned about (links forthcoming):



	
  * using Time Machine

	
  * Resetting an iPad

	
  * Restoring a bricked iPad

	
  * To not quit while you're ahead

	
  * Putting an iPad into DFU Mode

	
  * using TinyUmbrella to kick a device out of restore mode

	
  * Changing back the host entry that TinyUmbrellaÂ creates on install

	
  * Getting an iPad out of DFU mode

	
  * That it's really hard to "truly" brick an iPad.

	
  * Holding down the shift/option key to deploy a custom IPSW file.

	
  * Finally just using the Beta version of iTunes to install the update


After everything's said and done, I'm happy I did it even if it was a little scary when I couldn't get the device to turn back on. Happily using iOS 5 now, lots of improvement. As I right this I'm installing the update to Xcode in hopes of re-enabling the multi-touch gestures on my iPad 1 (which I've heard rumors that won't be available any more unless you have an iPad 2).
