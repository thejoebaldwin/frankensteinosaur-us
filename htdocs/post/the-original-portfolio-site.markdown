From the archives, my first portfolio site circa 2005. Wow. I like to call it [SOMEBODY PLEASE HIRE ME](http://www.joesharepoint.com/resources/jb5000/) Some of the links are broken because those sites don't exist anymore. Also, the rad page counter is out-of-commision. I've also taken a revisionist approach to the archives by adding analytics scripts to the bottom, in case you are appreciating my html aesthetic and come across that anachronism. Very hard to be in the pages and not edit the markup... there are div tags AFTER the body tag and it is taking everything I have right now not to fix it.
