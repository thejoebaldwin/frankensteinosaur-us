Demo I wrote about 2 1/2 years back with [Augmented Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality), using the [ARToolKit](http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/) and my OpenGL Vase code featured in [this post](http://joesharepoint.com/?p=135). I was able to dig it up (from the archives), get it working again and record it using Camtasia ([free trial](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/?gclid=CJik35fHy6sCFULBKgodRlex1g)). Easily the best use of AR I've seen so far is the Nintendo 3DS. One game, and I don't know which one, takes an image of the surface you have the marker on, and overlays it as a texture on the terrain of the game. It's difficult to get the impression AR gives you until you are the one in control of the camera, it really feels like you are looking at it (through the camera at least). Once [glasses like these](http://www.vuzix.com/ar/products_star1200.html) get cheaper and communicate with phones (and cooler looking), the applications of this will be all over the place. When I say "like this" I mean 3D Graphics overlays, not the HUD type apps like [Layar](http://www.layar.com/) or [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/yelpmobile) which are often described as Augmented Reality Apps.
