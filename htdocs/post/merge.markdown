I've said it [before](http://joesharepoint.com/?p=97) and [before again](http://joesharepoint.com/?p=116), but it's Â my blog and I will merge and split AS I SEE FIT. Anyways, I haven't wrote here in quite some time. That's not to say I haven't been blogging, but I've been doing so elsewhere. I've been SharePoint-ing so much since the release of 2010 that writing about it was the last thing on my mind, as that would have made it 100% of all my waking moments. I've moved all my other posts back here to joesharepoint.com, most are about general development, XNA and iOS. So you're probably thinking "but Joe, the name of the blog is JOE SHAREPOINT"... and I'd say, yes, yes it is. Think of it more as, half of the content is SharePoint, the other half is about Joe (me). Next Question.
