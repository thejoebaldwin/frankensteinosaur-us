I made this sketch using [Penultimate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) on my iPad while my son was in music class (no wi-fi, a guy's gotta do SOMETHING). Penultimate is GREAT; you can export your drawings to [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Evernote](http://evernote.com), or mail them as PDF's. This was sketch of [black mage character/class](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Mage_(Final_Fantasy)) from the original Final Fantasy on the NES:

With the help of [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and the sketch as an imported image, I can take my unfinished drawing and make it into something better:

One of my favorite things about Inkscape (and I imagine most Vector Art packages do this) is that you can group shapes together (Ctrl + G) so that you can manipulate them as a single object - scale (make larger of smaller), translate (move up, down, left, right) or rotate. You can make copies of that object as well (each smoke bubble was an object, look closer) - in the image below I changed the color scheme and enlarged one of the wizards, and copied & shrank two more (giving the illusion of depth).
