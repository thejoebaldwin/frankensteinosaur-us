I Started digging into 3DS Max these last 2 weeks as part of my quest to strengthen my design skills. There are some amazingly simple tutorials that you can download from the [autodesk site here](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=16759124&linkID=9241175), the first tutorial being a simple scene where you add some basic objects, add materials, camera and some animation. I won't post that resulting render video here, but this was the [basic idea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4fVvhmxZtA). Now, I've downloaded 3DS Max before and attempted to play around with it, but the interface was so intimidating (downright scary) I shelved it for a while. With the exception of the reflective surface, this is what I could do after only the first tutorial (not scared anymore). I spread it out over 4 or 5 days, in about 15 minutes sessions.

This short video clip took 30 minutes to render on a machine with 8GB of memory and an Intel Xeon (crazy, but hi-def looks so nice).
