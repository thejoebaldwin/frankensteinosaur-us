Three weeks ago I needed a little technological pick-me-up; I was in the market for a new phone but didn't want to fork over the cash for a smartphone dataplan (more on that later) and thought I could supplement smartphone features with a new netbook. That wasn't in the pocketbooks either, with my wonderfully high standards on what would make a netbook useful. I guess need some sponsors. So I needed something gadgety to make me feel like a winner. All the devs where I work had made the move to windows 7, but I stayed on Server 2008 (not R2) for SharePoint development reasons. I had been hearing that it (Windows 7) ran pretty good on old machines so I thought i would give it a go on my old Gateway Laption.

I ran the precheck and my graphics card was not going to give me the whole Aero Presentation deal. Ok. I burned the Windows 7 Ultimate ISO to a DVD and popped it in the laptop, and got the UMD error. I tried mounting the DVD Image with clonedrive same thing. I tried a hotfix but it didnt apply because I was XP SP2. I copied the files on the disk to one of the other machines on my home network a drive to it, and ran it from there. Sucess.....except on one of the restarts it froze and i had to power off. Not so good. On reboot it said it had encountered an error and had to restart, which it about 10 times before I got the hint. Had to reinstall Windows XP then do the whole install again. Success really this time. No other problems except a Kodak camera driver. The one from Kodak (Vista driver) didnt work but the one that Windows 7 by default applied did (pleasantly surprised). I also installed Windows 7 Ultimate on my old Server 2003 box and it went perfect. No Aero on this box either.

I can't really say that I've formed an opinion on Windows 7 yet. I've only used it for RDP so far. I guess I need to go to Newegg.com and get myself a $20 video card and see what the user experience is with Aero. I can say the boot time is super fast. Overall it seems very very solid.... no tweakiness like Vista. One gripe is my screensaver is a message that tells me my graphics card sucks, which makes me feel old and crusty. Haven't quite come to terms with that yet, but it's nothing $20 won't fix.
