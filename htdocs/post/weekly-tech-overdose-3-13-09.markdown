Every week I reach a point where I feel I should close the laptop and walk away, because there could not possibly be MORE to the internet than what I have already experienced (for good and for bad). Rather than bemoan my aching head and strained eyes, I thought I would share what keeps me coming back for more, thus begins my weekly installment of the Weekly Tech Overdose.

What I worked with the most this week:



	
  * [SharePoint Custom Actions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms465980.aspx)

	
  * [Chase Paymentech Integration](http://www.chasepaymentech.com/)

	
  * [Kentico](http://www.kentico.com/)


Tech I learned about this week that I find really exciting:

	
  * [Listable](http://www.listable.org/) - really like the sql export feature, very clever

	
  * [Torrent Droid](http://torrentfreak.com/torrent-droid-scan-barcodes-get-torrents-090311/) - amazing how many systems this integrates

	
  * [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice) - transcribes voicemail

	
  * [Zune & Audible.com Integration](http://www.zunerama.com/2008/09/get-zune-audiobooks-from-audible/) - did not know 3rd parties were plugging into the zune

	
  * [Vuzix VR920](http://www.vuzix.com/iwear/products_vr920.html) - more on this one later, but very cool


Sites/Tools I started using this week:

	
  * [Twello](http://www.twellow.com/)

	
  * [Just Tweet It](http://justtweetit.com/)

	
  * [Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)

	
  * [Google Webmaster](http://www.google.com/webmasters/)
