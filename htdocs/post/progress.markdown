Yesterday I had my first full day of development that I could dedicate towards my various development projects. So here's what I accomplished:  Return 2 - Sender: [Added metrics to the Postal Reports page](http://www.return2-sender.com/postalreport.aspx) Poor Man's Data Plan:[ Fixed registration page](http://www.poormansdataplan.com/register.aspx) error, been broken since July! One would think at least ONE data plan starved person could have located my [gigantic email address](http://www.humboldttechgroup.com/contact.aspx). Also added email confirmation to a successful submit.  Other - Reworked a site layout on one of my other projects that isn't ready for prime time yet. Need a pilot! Hence the update. The old layout was sort of weak.  XNA - Got a simple HUD display up for debugging purposes. You really can't step into code that fires that quick and get any meaningful data out it.
