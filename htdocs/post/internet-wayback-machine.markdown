Spent the last couple days crawling through the underbelly of the internet, looking to export models from classic 1999 Everquest into 3DS Max, for use as testing models in XNA 4.0. I suceeded, but it wasn't pretty (at one point the internet wayback machine was required for geocities). I've been attempting to recover a weapon model pictured here, the Jade Chodikai Prod; can you believe there is not a single image of this to be found on the internet? So here is my public service today. Also, started using EpicWin on my ipod, completely awesome.
