Using Triangle Strip (like Quad strip) to draw the squares. Code is inside a function (method? message?) taking multiple parameters.. in this case x and y. Doing a rotate, draw the squares, clear matrix, rotate other direction and draw other squares (with changing color in between). Also learned to zoom in while recording with Quicktime on Mac (ctrl + mousewheel).
