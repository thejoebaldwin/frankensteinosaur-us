I believe over the weekend the 50th copy of this app was sold, serving as motivation for me to put a video up of it. It's a simple "toy" app of a traffic light. I used 3 quads, and swapped the textures out for each one (one texture for on, another for off). The quad itself had the color on the rendered polygon. You can get it here at the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/play-stoplight/id475205154)
