Also, In case it wasn't obvious: I created this site today. In response to killing off [The Ascetic Technologist](http://ascetictechnologist.humboldttechgroup.com) yesterday. I just could not bring myself to write enough content to justify a blog post. I think I like Tumblr format better. Longer than twitter to keep from getting (or staying) snarky and shorter than blog to keep from getting long winded.  Edit: 2/10/11: I still love Tumblr, but I have decided to stop fighting my reservations about posting non-SharePoint items on this Blog. Yeah yeah, Joe SharePoint, I know. Well, it's MY blog. "joetoomanydifferenttopics.com" doesn't have a nice ring to it.
