I wanted to link to my [Github repository](https://github.com/thejoebaldwin), but as you may have noticed my personal links are all icons. Overplayed Web 2.0 or not, I like my 32 x 32 icons. A search of "Git Icons" did not bring up anything that I was in love with, so I made my own. I won't say I'm particularly in love with these either, but I do "like" them. Right click the link below each image and click "save as".

After I finished the icon, was talking to a co-worker to show them what was out there and searched for [Github Icons](https://www.google.com/search?q=github+icons&hl=en&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&biw=1199&bih=679) instead, which is really what I was looking for all along, and the Cat/Squid is WAY cooler. You may not, however like the Cat-Squid chimaera, so please feel free to use mine.
