New domain for $3.98 on the namecheap. Too good to pass up and the joesharepoint.com thing is getting old. Been buried under projects since my last post in spring, and don't like to blog when I'm begging deadlines, but I think I'm going to anyways since that is just the state of things.  One of my favorite quotes is "I don't know what I think until I see what I say", and it helps to shake loose the cobwebs.  Anyways, Here's an image of a badass frankenstein dinosaur. Also: [Mike Mignola Homunclulus](http://hellboy.wikia.com/wiki/Homunculus), and [Wikipedia Homunculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus).
