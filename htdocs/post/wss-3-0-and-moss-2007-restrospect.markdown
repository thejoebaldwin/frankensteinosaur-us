Yesterday I passed the last of four SharePoint MCTS certifications. Since I've been putting off writing until I finished my certifications, I am faced with the inarguable fact that I no longer have a defense in procrastination. With the upcoming SharePoint 2010, I thought I would share my impressions during my past (almost) 4 years with SharePoint.




I started working with the beta version of WSS 3.0 back in early 2006 for a client interested in using it as a way of collecting leads from an internet-facing form and routing them to a secure, intranet site. The early solution (before I got to it) used webservices and list event receivers. I don't even know if anyone even knew about workflows in Visual Studio back then, and SharePoint Designer 2007 still required a license. This solution has since grown to a 1000+ user, extranet, intranet and internet site and continues to grow in use and features. I've worked on this site on and off four the 4 years since, and I've used it to gauge the pace at which the perceived usability of SharePoint has grown. I've been very lucky to be able to work with a client that is very comfortable with new technology, and forward thinking enough to see how a tool like Sharepoint is a great fit for their business.




It is absolutely incredible at which the level of pervasity technology has achieved in the past four years. For certain, some visionary somewhere had thought of a concept like Facebook, or Google Wave, and certainly something like the iPhone years before. But I don't think anyone saw it coming that someone would actually ever use any of these tools, and if you told me about Twitter I would say "I already have IM", and that a device like the iPhone would come from Apple? Forget it. The level at which users are comfortable with technology is not even in a recognizable state as it was back when this recent version of SharePoint came out.




In 2006 I was working primarily in .NET and a Microsoft product called Microsoft Content Management Server 2002, and even the concept of CMS was fairly new to the Enterprise. Tools like MySpace, Facebook, Ebay, Craiglist and Twitter have driven away (mostly) the stigma of placing personal content out on the internet. It's not the invention of these platforms that has been driving users online, but rather the hardware that they can use for it, and we are certainly on the cusp of another (more on that in another post). Cheap Laptops, Netbooks and Mobile Phones have been half of the puzzle, the other half is Wi-Fi and Mobile Broadband/Data Access. I never thought I would be writing blogs, using Facebook or Twitter; but my [first blog post](http://sharepointjoe.blogspot.com/2007/05/moss-2007-smtp-and-pop3.html), my [first tweet](http://twitter.com/baldwinjoe/status/1156087118), and my [Facebook profile](http://www.facebook.com/joebaldwin). And I can update them all by texting from my phone! But I digress; it certainly is a different landscape than when WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 came out.




What is really interesting is that WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 have thrived in these four years, and have grown past the initial impression of SharePoint as a Document Management system. Collaboration has been so strongly stressed on every project I have been on in the past year as one of the driving factors for a SharePoint implementation, that the Document Management has almost been an afterthought. Clients are getting comfortable with the idea that SharePoint is a platform that should fit their business model and processes rather than having to settle with a half-fulfilled product and work their business around it. Microsoft has also since embraced an open-source model with the Codeplex site, and a multitude of excellent tools commmunity developed to extend SharePoint even further.




So what can we expect in the next four years? SharePoint 2010 is certainly feature-rich, and many of the usability and compliance issues have been addressed. Upcoming technologies such as augmented reality, realtime search, semantic seb, rich internet and 3D web will all be coming to maturity before SharePoint 2014 comes out. This past framework has been robust enough to account for usages probably not imagined. It will be exciting to watch and see how this product will look in 4 years... I also have a feeling that it will be a long time before WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007 ride off into the sunset.
