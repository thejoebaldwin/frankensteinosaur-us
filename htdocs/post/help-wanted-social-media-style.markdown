Here is an "Information Age" experiment for my own benefit. I am looking for a stuffed animal for my son that they have on a decorative aisle poster/thing at Target, and I've asked several times and they don't carry it. I don't know if they've EVER carried it. [Here's a picture](http://bit.ly/yhFZ). Do you know what this product is called, and who is it made by? I've posted this on Facebook, Twitter, and now here on my blog, as of 1:30pm on a Saturday. Does the internet work this way yet? Am I sufficiently networked with enough people that I can get ANY information that I need? I will post my results and thoughts here. And please, think of the children.
