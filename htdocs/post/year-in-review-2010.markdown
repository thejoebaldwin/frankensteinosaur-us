![](/r2s_yir.jpg) Return 2 - Sender Year in review: What a great year! 1476 visits to our website, Â over 640 emails returned (we lost our data prior to 3/27/10 so it's probably closer to 1000+). We've compiled a graph (everyone loves graphs) of emails rejected per week over the course of 2010 (Interestingly enough, Return 2 - Sender use peaks before most major U.S. holidays?) We hope to provide more stuff like this to our users in the new year... it's good to know you're not the only one sending those emails back right before Thanksgiving ;)  Once again, thank you for using Return 2 - Sender and we look forward to getting the word out to an even larger audience in 2011!
