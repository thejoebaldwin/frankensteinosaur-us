#Commercial VPLs
##Dealer Locator/Request for Information Enhancement##
***
**Requirements**  

- On RFI form landing, change "Vertical Platform Lifts" to "Residential Vertical Platform Lifts"
- Add message to same block "See below for commercial VPLs"
- On RFI form add radio button "Commercial Accessibility/Commercial Vertical Platform"
- "Commerical VPL" Lead generated by RFI form submission will be marked as In-house, and be processed the same other In-house leads.
- No impact to existing Dealer Locator Form

**Implementation**

- Ideal solution should impact existing process as little as possible, and maintain VPL reporting and system product lines 
- The "Vertical Platform Lifts" radio button will be changed to read "Residential Platform Lifts"
- A hard-coded radio button will be added beneath "Residential Platform Lifts" with the text "Commerical Accessibility/Commerical Vertical Platform Lifts". Currently this list is generated by reading brunoportal.com configuration data
- A change to the RFI form logic will submit "Commerical VPL" as an In-house VPL lead, no changes to brunoportal.com configuration data will be required/executed.
- A "**Commercial VPL\*\*" header will prefix the comments to notify/visually call-out the user routing in-house leads.

**Considerations**  

- The above proposed implementation is with the assumption that the existing VPL product line behaviors should stay in place (Documents, Lead Maps, Metros, etc) and that no dealers will be designated as "Commerical VPL" dealers. 
- This implementation does not prohibit a future "Commerical VPL" product line, but no foundation is being put into place within this solution to account for such a feature addition, aside from the RFI form changes
- A DNS entry for dev.bruno.com will be required for pre-production testing.
