<h1>Crypto LabelMaker – Computer Security</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was a client/server program involving a 
password-sharing scheme. The key required to digitally sign a message could only 
be constructed when three of the generated passwords were present. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passwords were generated using a threshold scheme 
(A. Shamir, “How to share a secret” <i>Communications of the ACM ,v. 24, n.11 
Nov 1979</i>). We wish for the key to be constructed using three passwords so we 
used a polynomial of degree 2 (3-1 = 2).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password = f(x) = (ax^2 +bx 
+ M) mod P</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>P</b> a prime, <b>M</b> the key, and <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>,<b>
</b>are all chosen at random. <b>P</b> is kept, <b>M</b>, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> 
are discarded afterwards. Evaluating the polynomial at different points 
generates “partial” passwords. To reconstruct the key, <b>M</b>, the set of 3 
equations were solved through polynomial interpolation to give back <b>a</b> and
<b>b</b>, in which then <b>M</b> could be determined.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the passwords are generated initially, a public 
key (server side) would also be generated, and distributed along with the 
individual passwords. To reconstruct the key, each user would run the client 
program and enter their password. When three keys were entered, the original key 
would be reconstructed. An arbitrary message would be encrypted using an RSA 
scheme with the private key and then would be used as a digital signature on a 
document. Should the authenticity of the signature come into question, the 
public key would be used to decrypt it and the result would match the original 
message.&nbsp; </p>
