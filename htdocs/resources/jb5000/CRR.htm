<h1>CRR – Software Engineering / Independent Study</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this project was to implement the Chinese 
Remainder Representation (CRR) in such a way that adding (or subtracting, etc.) 
two very large numbers could be done in a single, parallel operation, thereby 
greatly decreasing the time it takes to do such things like mathematical 
operations in cryptography.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese Remainder Representation is a way of 
representing a number using an array of remainders. An array of prime numbers 
larger than 5 are used as moduli, the length of the array depending on the size 
of the largest number you wish to represent. Each CRR number will be an array of 
equal length, with each corresponding remainder in the CRR being the result of 
the original number modulo its corresponding prime. Addition, subtraction, and 
multiplication can all be done on these CRR’s as you would on any integer 
(division is a bit different and a subject of a 60-page paper). So, if CRR_1, 
CRR_2, and CRR_3 are arrays of remainders, CRR_3=CRR_1 + CRR_2 would entail….</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CRR_3[0] = CRR_1[0] + CRR_2[0]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CRR_3[1] = CRR_1[1] + CRR_2[1]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>. . .</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CRR_3[n] = CRR_1[n] + CRR_2[n]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first stage of this project was to take an 
existing software package and get it to compile with the most current version of 
C++ and a new large number package, ln3. After the project was functional and 
correctness was verified, the package was implemented to work across many 
parallel machines (as many machines as remainders), using MPICH. This involved 
sending a remainder and a remainder, or a remainder and a long, with a flag to 
designate which operation would be performed. At the parallel machines the 
operation would be performed and the resulting remainder would be returned. </p>
